**[Project] Real Time Object Detection on Raspberry Pi using TensorFlow Lite SSD**  

This application detects multiple objects in a scene. The most commonly used models are the SSD (Single Shot Detection) and YOLO (You Only Looks Once). The COCO SSD MobileNet v1 recognizes 80 different objects. It can detect up to ten objects in a single scene. 

-  <em> A fast C++ implementation of TensorFlow Lite on a bare Raspberry Pi 4 64-bit OS.</em>  

-  <em> 24 FPS! Without any hardware accelerator, just you and your Pi. </em>
